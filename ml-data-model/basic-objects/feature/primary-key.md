# Primary Key

Each [data-source.md](../../storage-location/data-source.md "mention") may designate one of more of its [.](./ "mention")(s) as a Primary Key. If a list of Features is given, it is assumed that together they form a composite Primary Key.

A Primary Key is a unique identifier for individual observations in the [data-source.md](../../storage-location/data-source.md "mention") (eg. a unique identifier for individual rows in a table), so no two observations should have the same Primary Key values.

All Features from the same Data Source, represent attributes of an observation / entity, uniquely identified by its Primary Key value.
