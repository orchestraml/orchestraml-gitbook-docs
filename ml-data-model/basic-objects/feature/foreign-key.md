If a [trained-model](../../wip/trained-model/ "mention") depends on [.](./ "mention")(s) from more than one [data-source.md](../../storage-location/data-source.md "mention"), each with its own[primary-key.md](primary-key.md "mention"), then a Foreign Key to join the Features must be specified (at the level of [model-training-code.md](../../wip/code-block/model-training-code.md "mention")).
