# Predicted Label

A [.](./ "mention") is implied to be a [predicted-label.md](predicted-label.md "mention") when its [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") value includes a [trained-model](../../wip/trained-model/ "mention"). The [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") value may optionally also include the specific [model-serving-code.md](../../wip/code-block/model-serving-code.md "mention") used, as well as any input [.](./ "mention")(s) to it.
