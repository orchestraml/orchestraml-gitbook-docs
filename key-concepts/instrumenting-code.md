# Instrumenting Code

To instrument python code with Orchestra, there are two steps&#x20;

1. Define Code Blocks, and their in-memory input and output Features (and Models, if any)&#x20;
2. Add inputs and outputs that are read from or written to any external location.

### 1. Define Code Blocks, and their in-memory inputs and outputs

* Delineate the start and end of each block with the commands `orchestra.log_code_block('codeblock_name').start()` and `orchestra.log_code_block('codeblock_name').end()`&#x20;
* Provide any in-memory Data Sources (i.e. pandas dataframes) that are passed to the Code Block as inputs or outputs.&#x20;
  * Use the `input_features` parameter in the `start()` command&#x20;
  * Use the `output_features` parameter in the `end()` command&#x20;
* Provide any in-memory Models that are passed to the Code Block as inputs or outputs
  * Use the `input_models` parameter in the `start()` command&#x20;
  * Use the `output_models` parameter in the `end()` command&#x20;

NOTE: Orchestra matches the in-memory objects of consecutive code blocks to each other by using their pythonID. So if additional processing is happening between the code blocks (which isnâ€™t visible to Orchestra) that changes the pythonID, the lineage may not be propagated correctly.

### 2. Add inputs and outputs that are read from or written to any external location

a) Add Features and their Data Sources using the `orchestra.log_features()` command

b) Add Models and their Model Registries using the `orchestra.log_model()` command

### Put another way

There are _two ways that Features can be defined as inputs_ to a given run of a Code Block.  They may be&#x20;

1. Read in from an external data source, within the Code Block, and then registered with Orchestra using the `log_features()` command.&#x20;
2. Passed directly, as columns of an in-memory dataframe, and registered with Orchestra using the `log_codeblock().start()` command.

Similarly, there are _two ways that Features can be defined as outputs_ to a given run of a Code Block. They may be

1. Written to an external data source, within the Code Block, and then registered with Orchestra using the `log_features()` command.
2. Passed directly, as columns of an in-memory dataframe, and registered with Orchestra using the `log_codeblock().end()` command.

### 3. Phone Home

Orchestralib collects basic metadata about usage. This comprises of timestamp, hostname, organization name, etc.

To opt out of this set the environment variable `ORCHESTRAML_PHONE_HOME` to `False`.
